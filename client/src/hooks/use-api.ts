// This file is no longer needed for static site
// All data is now handled through static imports from the data folder
// You can delete this file and use direct imports instead:

// import { teamMembers } from "@/data/team-data";
// import { projects } from "@/data/projects-data";
// import { events } from "@/data/events-data";

export {}; // Empty export to make this a valid module
